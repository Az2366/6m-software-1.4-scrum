## Assignment

### Brief

Write your answers for each scenario:

Scenario 1:
Imagine you are hired by a startup company for a school to implement their IT infrastructure as their IT consultant. n your own words (300 words or less), describe how could implementing Scrum help their IT team improve their productivity.

```
1. Scrum may help a startup school's IT staff become more productive by giving a clear, disciplined approach to project management. 
2. Scrum divides enormous projects into smaller, more manageable sprints, allowing the team to focus on particular goals and achieve results fast. 
3. Daily stand-up meetings enable frequent communication, allowing team members to report progress, identify roadblocks, and resolve issues quickly. 
4. This transparency keeps the project on schedule and reduces delays. The iterative structure of Scrum also helps the team to be adaptable, responding to changes or new priorities as they occur, which is critical in a fast-paced startup setting.

```

Scenario 2:
Write ten (10) user stories for a book-borrowing website for a library. Write it in the format: `As a ____, I want to ____, so that _____`.

```
1. As a library member, I want to search for books by title, author, or genre, so that I can easily find the books I am interested in.
2. As a library member, I want to reserve a book that is currently checked out, so that I can borrow it as soon as it becomes available.
3. As a library member, I want to extend the due date of a borrowed book, so that I can have more time to finish reading it if needed.
4. As a librarian, I want to manage user accounts and reset passwords, so that I can assist members with accessing their accounts.
5. As a library member, I want to receive reminders about upcoming due dates, so that I can return borrowed books on time and avoid late fees.
6. As a librarian, I want to generate reports on book borrowings and reservations, so that I can analyze the libraryâ€™s usage patterns and manage inventory effectively.
7. As a librarian, I want to add new books to the library's online catalog, so that library members can see and borrow them.
8. As a system engineer, I want to implement database encryption for user data, so that sensitive information like passwords and borrowing history is protected from unauthorized access.
9. As a librarian, I want to view and manage overdue books, so that I can send reminders to members and track fines.
10. As a librarian, I want to manage book inventory, including adding new books and removing old or damaged ones, so that the catalog reflects the current collection.
